## What is Transaction?

A transaction is a series of actions or operations performed within a system or business process that results in a change or transfer of goods, services, or information. It involves the exchange of resources between two or more parties, typically with the aim of achieving a specific goal or objective.

Transactions can occur in various contexts, including financial transactions, business transactions, and computer transactions. In financial terms, a transaction refers to the buying or selling of goods, services, or financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Business transactions involve activities such as purchasing supplies, signing contracts, and making payments.

Computer transactions refer to the execution of commands or operations within a computer system. These can include tasks like data entry, database updates, file transfers, and online purchases.

Transactions are typically characterized by certain key attributes:

1. Atomicity: A transaction is considered atomic if it is treated as a single unit of work that either completes successfully in its entirety or fails completely without any intermediate state being saved.

2. Consistency: A transaction should transform the system from one consistent state to another. It ensures that all constraints and rules governing the system are maintained throughout the transaction.

3. Isolation: Transactions should be executed in isolation from other concurrent transactions to prevent interference and maintain data integrity.

4. Durability: Once a transaction is committed and completed successfully, its changes should be permanent and survive any subsequent failures or system crashes.

Transactions play a crucial role in various industries and sectors by facilitating secure and reliable exchanges of goods, services, information, and funds. They provide accountability and transparency while ensuring that parties involved can trust the outcome of their interactions.
