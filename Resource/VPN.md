## What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows users to create a secure and private network connection over a public network, such as the internet. It essentially creates a tunnel between your device and the VPN server, encrypting all the data that passes through it. This ensures that your online activities remain private and secure from prying eyes, including your Internet Service Provider (ISP), hackers, and government agencies. Additionally, VPNs can be used to bypass geographical restrictions by changing your IP address to appear as though you are accessing the internet from another location.
