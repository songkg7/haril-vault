## What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network infrastructure that allows users to create and manage their own isolated network environment within a public cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform ([[Google Cloud Platform|GCP]]). A VPC provides a secure and isolated environment for running applications and services, enabling users to control the network topology, IP address range, subnets, routing tables, and security settings. With a VPC, users can launch and manage virtual machines (VMs), databases, load balancers, and other services in their own private network within the cloud. This provides greater flexibility, scalability, and security for enterprise applications and IT infrastructure.
