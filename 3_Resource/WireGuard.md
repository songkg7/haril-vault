## What is WireGuard

WireGuard is an open-source software application and protocol that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point connections in routed or bridged configurations. It is designed to be simpler and easier to audit than other VPN protocols, and it offers better performance and more secure encryption. WireGuard was officially incorporated into the Linux kernel in 2020.
